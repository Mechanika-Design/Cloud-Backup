# Cloud Backup
A flexible, powerful, and easy to use rolling incremental backup system that pushes collated, compressed, and encrypted data to online cloud storage services, local attached storage, and network storage.

This tool is "experimental" at the moment.  It works but you are mostly on your own until documentation rolls out and is tested thoroughly in production environments.

This backup system supports OpenDrive, Amazon Cloud Drive, Cloud Storage Server, and local backup.
